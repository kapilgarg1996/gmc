==================
MusicSet Class API
==================

.. currentmodule:: gmc.dataset.musicset

This document covers the API for :class:`MusicSet` class.

.. class:: MusicSet(force_load=False, genres=None)
	
	This class holds the files information of the dataset and it
	prepares a mapping of filename to their genres for correct
	labels used in ML algorithms.

	``force_load`` specifies whether the files data and label mapping
	should be reloaded if a cached mapping exists previously.

	``genres`` is a list provided to load a specific set of genres
	instead of all genres specified in :ref:`settings.py <settings-module>`

	.. attribute:: dataset_dir

		Set to ``settings.DATASET_DIR``

	.. attribute:: results_dir

		Set to ``settings.BRAIN_DIR``

	.. attribute:: files

		A dictionary containing mappings between genres and absolute file
		paths. eg. files['pop'] is a list of all file paths present in 'pop'
		folder in dataset directory.

	.. method:: load_files()

		It loads all the files and stores them in :attr:`files`. It skips
		the non-existent genre folder.

	.. note::

		Currently, ``gmc`` only supports **wav** file formats and thus 
		:meth:`load_files` only loads **wav** files.
