Settings Reference

.. currentmodule:: gmc.conf

This document covers the features of :class:`~gmc.conf.Settings` class.
It also covers the options available for environment settings.

.. _settings-overview:

``Overview``
============

After installation of :mod:`gmc` module, a :mod:`settings` module is
important to configure ``gmc``. The ``settings`` module path can be
explicitly provided to ``gmc`` command. If not provided, then the
current working directory will be assumed to have the ``settings``
module.

The :ref:`gmc command <gmc-command>` can work in any of the following
ways:

.. code-block:: console
	$ gmc
	$ gmc path/to/my/settings.py
	$ gmc path.to.my.settings

If the provided path is a directory path then gmc will try to convert
slashes with ``.`` and will try to import the module. This means that
all the directories relative to ``settings.py`` must be python modules.

.. _settings-module

``settings.py`` module
======================

To configure ``gmc``, it is important to create a ``settings.py`` module
which is importable. You can create a ``settings.py`` file in the directory
from where the ``gmc`` command is to be run for convinience.


``Settings Options``
====================

Currently, there are only 2 available options for ``gmc``.

.. _dataset-dir-option:

``DATASET_DIR``

This setting specifies the path where the dataset is stored. It is important
that the dataset format is same as the one mentioned in dataset documentation.
By default, it is set to ``/tmp``


``BRAIN_DIR``

This setting will specify the directory where ``GMC`` will store its results
files, feature files and other important files. By default, it is set to ``/tmp``

The following file format shows how to create your ``settings.py`` module

.. snippet::
	:filename: settings.py

	DATASET_DIR = '/home/kapil/dataset'
	BRAIN_DIR 	= '/home/kapil/results'
